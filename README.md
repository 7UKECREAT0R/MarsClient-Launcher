# TitanixClient
Completely external Minecraft launcher and client which works with all versions of Minecraft including vanilla.

-----------------------------
This software was designed originally as a paid commission around a year ago, but the client dropped the project, so I continued to work on this project as my own.

> Note: The codebase for this launcher is incredibly messy and was more of a mock-up than what I intended to be a full project!
> This project also runs off of CmlLib for handling the launching, but performs all the logging in and session management itself.
-----------------------------
The features/upcoming features in this "client" include:
- [x] Full session management.
- [x] No password storing.
